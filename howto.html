    First of all, you are going to need a GitHub profile. Head over to
    <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a> and click Sign Up in the upper
    right corner. Enter your e-mail, the preferred user name and a password.
    Confirm your e-mail and sign in to your GitHub account.
  </p>
  <p>
    On your computer, create an <b>index.html</b> file using VSCode or the
    command line or even a text editor. Edit this file and write the following
    in it:
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>&#60;html&#62;</p>
  <p>
    &#60;h1&#62; <b>________</b>'s (insert your name) portfolio &#60; &frasl; h1
    &#62;
  </p>
  <p>&#60;img src=./myphoto.jpg &frasl; &#62;</p>
  <p>&#60; &frasl; html &#62;</p>
  <br />
  <p>
    Pick a picture of yourself and copy it to the same folder where index.html
    is stored. You can name the file anything you want, but make sure to edit
    the code above after the <b> &#60;img src=</b> to reference that file name
    instead of <b>myphoto.jpg </b>
  </p>
  <p>
    On the GitHub website, click on your avatar in the upper right hand corner
    to open a drop down menu, go to "Your Repositories". Press the green button
    that says "New"
  </p>
  <p>
    Under "Repository Name" type a name you want. Could be your first and last
    names in lower case letters with no spaces. Follow it with
    <b>.github.io</b>. On the bottom of the page, click "Create Repository".
  </p>
  <p>
    First thing you'll see is going to be the quick set up page. Click "upload
    an existing file". That will take you to a page where you can drag and drop
    your index.html and your photo files.
  </p>
  <p>
    You will see a list of the files you drag and dropped and a green button
    "Commit changes". Click that button!
  </p>
  <p>
    Now your Repository is ready to access! You can type
    <b>yourfirstandlastname.github.io</b> (for example) in the URL line in your
    browser and you'll see your page!
  </p>
  <p>If you don't see your page, go to &#60;Code&#62; in the upper left corner. On the right, under Environments, click "github-pages", that should take you to your newly deployed page </p>
